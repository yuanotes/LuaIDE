#LuaIDE

An auto-completion plugin for sublime text 3 for Lua.

**NOTE: It's quite unstable now.**

You can press `ctrl-l  ctrl-r` to rebuild the syntax cache.
It would take about **30 seconds** for a big project. So, be careful.

It would be greate to have a server like ternjs to build the cache simultaneously in the background. That may be my next weekend project.
